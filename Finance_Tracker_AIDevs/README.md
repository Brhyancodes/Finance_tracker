### üéØ Prompting Strategy

**Sample Prompt 1 - Component Generation:**
```
"Generate a React component for displaying monthly spending trends with the following requirements:
- Uses Recharts for visualization
- Connects to Supabase table 'transactions' with columns: id, user_id, amount, category, date, description
- Implements proper TypeScript interfaces based on Supabase auto-generated types
- Includes loading states and error handling
- Filters transactions by date range and category
- Follows our established component patterns with Tailwind styling"
```

**Sample Prompt 2 - Testing Generation:**
```
"Create a comprehensive test suite for the budget calculation engine with these specifications:
- Test the calculateMonthlyBudget function that processes transactions array
- Include edge cases: negative amounts, future dates, missing categories, decimal precision
- Mock Supabase client calls and test RLS policy enforcement
- Generate realistic financial test data covering different user spending patterns
- Follow Jest best practices with describe blocks and proper assertions
- Test both successful calculations and error scenarios"
```

**Sample Prompt 3 - Schema-Aware Generation:**
```
"Using the provided Supabase schema for tables 'users', 'transactions', and 'categories', generate:
- TypeScript interfaces that extend Supabase auto-generated types
- RLS policies ensuring users can only access their own financial data
- A custom hook useTransactions() that includes real-time subscriptions
- Form validation schema using Zod that matches database constraints
- Include proper foreign key relationships and cascade behaviors"
